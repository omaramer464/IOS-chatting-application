# IOS-chatting-application
The app is capable of logging the user in if they got an account, and allows them to create one if they don't. The user can search for other people to chat with using the search mechanism that allows the user to search for others using their usernames. Then they can start a chat. the chat looks a lot more like the instagrams chat, but reply, like, and showing when the other user is typing are features that I didn't have enough time to implement. there is a setting page where you can switch the application's theme between dark and light. Deleting chats, and removing friends features are functional. Below are some pictures of the application:

<h1> Note </h1>

The project uses Firebase's firestore database, the GoogleService-info.plist file is removed from the project's files. To be able to use the application, create a firestore database on Firebase and download the GoogleService-info.plist file and add it to the project's root file and make sure to select "create groups" for the added folders pop-up.

This project is not completely done, it is functional but has some missing and uncompleted features. The main reason behind creating this project was to test my ability in creating a replica of WhatsApp with some tweaks.
